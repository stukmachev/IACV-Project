Project for Image Analysis and Computer Vision subject

Have in mind:
The project delivery for a Project must include the following items:
(i) The developed code (e.g. Matlab) provided with the needed user instructions
(ii) Experimental files: all what is needed to replicate experiments or to compare your approach with subsequent approaches in future projects, including:
 - input images or videos, 
 - possible text files with additional information about acquisition conditions (e.g. camera intrisic parameters), 
 - ground truth (e.g. true positions or identification or trajectory of observed objects), 
 - intermediate results of your processing algorithm, 
 - final results of your processing algorithm.
(iii) A well-written self-sufficient pdf report including 
 - the problem formulation (with a short motivation of its relevance), 
 - a short outline of the state of the art, 
 - your solution approach, 
 - the description of your implementation, 
 - the experimental activity and the analysis of experimental results, 
 - final conclusions, also including some problems left open.
(iv) Slides for an oral presentation: same structure as the report structure
